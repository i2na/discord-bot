# Project Overview

A Daily News Curator Discord Bot that fetches Korean news, analyzes it using OpenAI (GPT-4o) to provide educational insights for 20s professionals, and sends a report via Discord Webhook.

# Tech Stack

-   **Language:** Python 3.9+
-   **Deployment:** Vercel Serverless Functions
-   **AI:** OpenAI API
-   **Integration:** Discord Webhook

# Architecture & Structure

-   **`api/`**: Vercel entry point (`cron.py`). Handles request/response only.
-   **`config/`**:
    -   `constants.py`: Centralized settings and environment variables.
    -   `prompt.txt`: System prompt for the AI. **Edit personality here.**
-   **`services/`**: Core logic split into fetching, analyzing, and notifying.

# Key Rules

1. **Separation of Concerns:** Keep logic separate from configuration. Use `config/` for all constants and prompts.
2. **Vercel Compatibility:** Use absolute paths (via `os.path`) for file reading to ensure compatibility with Vercel's serverless environment.
3. **Prompt Management:** Never hardcode prompts in Python files; always read from `config/prompt.txt`.
